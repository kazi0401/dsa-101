Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation

Write a function that takes in a list and evaluates it in
Reverse Polish Notation.

Reverse Polish Notation:
    Operators are followed by their operands
        Ex.
        ['10', '4', '*'] -> 10 * 4 -> 40
        ['2', '1', '+', '3', '*'] -> (2 + 1) * 3 -> 9
        
The input is a list of strings.
Each string either represents an integer, or an operator (+, -, *, /)
Division should be interpreted as integer division (//)
Do not worry about division by 0.

Name the function eval_rpn.
