We'll be using Git to share our code and work on things together!

    Command                                 Explanation
        git add .                               stages all your changes 
        git commit -m "message"                 'snapshots' all staged changes
        git push                                publishes your new code
        git pull                                receive any updates from me.
        git status                              shows you what's being tracked/untracked
        git branch                              shows you what branch you're on

    
    Basic Workflow
        Frequently add + commit while you work
            Commiting often lets you 'rollback' your code to older verisons
        Push, once you're done
            Gives me access to your changes
        Pull, whenever you need the latest assignment from me.
